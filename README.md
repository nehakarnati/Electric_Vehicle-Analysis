# Electric_Vehicle-Analysis


# Project Overview
This project provides an analysis and visualization of electric vehicle (EV) sales trends across the United States. By utilizing different data analysis and visualization methods, successfully got valuable insights.


# Features
# Choropleth map
A choropleth map is a thematic map that is used to represent statistical data using color mapping symbology technique.It displays enumeration units,or divided geographical users or regions that are colored,shaded or patterned in relation to a data variable.

Choropleth Map of EVs by State(created using plotly.express): Visualizes the distribution of electric vehicles across U.S. states.

# Racing Bar Chart
It is a popluar form of data visualization that can be used to show changes overtime.
Racing Bar Chart of EV Sales by Manufacturer: Shows the changing landscape of top EV manufacturers over the years through an animated racing bar chart.
